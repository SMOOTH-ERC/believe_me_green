## General Information
Here we provide the full code of the dynamic investment model with heterogenous expectations and climate policy uncertainty developed in Campiglio et al. (2023). Further, we provide pieces of code to replicate figures from the paper.


## Programming Language
Matlab/Octave


## Usage

1. Dowload all files
2. To view the model code: open the file "model_function.m" 
3. To run the model: use open the file "run.m" and run it
4. To plot results and replicate the figures of the paper: open the files in the "Figures code" folder and run them
